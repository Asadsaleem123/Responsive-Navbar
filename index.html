                    <p>
                         can get complicated really quickly,
                          but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways to simplify your life,
                           a few of which we've explored in the past. This week we're taking a
                            bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life 
                            you already living.

                    <h2>Keeping cooking simple</h2>
                    <p >
                         Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have to eat healthy.
                          One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.</p>

                    <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
                    <p> Work is often a major source of stress.
                         People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship with 
                         others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life
                          as simple as possible, it will help balance everything out.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
                    <p> A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little.
                         People either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have
                          the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye
                           where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
